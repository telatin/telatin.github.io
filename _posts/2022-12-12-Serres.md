> A summary of the book chapter [Il genoma dei portainnesti: similarità e differenze con Vitis vinifera](https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/3201768), by Valle, Vitulo, Vannozzi, Telatin and Lucchini
 
## Introduction

In the last decade, genomic analysis technologies have made incredible progress, enabling highly accurate genome sequencing of many organisms, 
including the human genome (published in 2001) and the grapevine genome (published in 2007). 
While knowing a genome's sequence is important, it's crucial to understand that the sequence alone doesn't reveal the full meaning of the information it contains.

## Background
Just as with the human genome, post-genomic research for other organisms involves trying to associate genes with their biological processes to determine each gene's biological function. However, before this can happen, genes must be identified by locating their physical boundaries within the genomic sequence: start, end, and splicing sites.

In reality, the three processes of sequencing, prediction, and annotation of a genome are never truly complete:
- Sequencing should lead to increasingly precise definition of each species' reference genome
- Gene prediction continuously improves through cDNA analysis and RNA sequencing
- Gene annotation evolves with functional genomics research

## Rootstock Genome Sequencing
The first grapevine genome sequence was published in Nature in 2007, based on a highly homozygous Pinot Noir genotype called PN40024. This identified approximately 30,000 genes, of which about 26,000 were annotated. The PN40024 sequence has since served as a crucial reference point for all genetic studies in grapevine.

## Key Findings

| Rootstock | High-quality variants | SNPs | InDels | Density (variants per 2Kb) |
|-----------|---------------------|------|--------|--------------------------|
| M4        | 1,671,472          | 1,654,955 | 16,517 | 7.89 ± 7.17 |
| M1        | 3,641,652          | 3,585,346 | 56,306 | 15.63 ± 10.73 |
| 101.14    | 2,233,051          | 2,186,705 | 46,346 | 9.72 ± 7.11 |

 
## Conclusions

The genomic analysis of the three rootstocks provided interesting and partly unexpected results:

1. Rootstock properties appear to be based on polymorphisms rather than unique genes - they share essentially the same genes as V. vinifera but with different variants.

2. Surprisingly, the differences between rootstocks and the PN40024 reference genome are similar in magnitude to those found within V. vinifera species, despite rootstocks being derived from crosses between different Vitis species.

3. The similarity between rootstock genomes and PN40024 sequence enabled the use of AGER-SERRES project data to significantly improve gene prediction and annotation of the V. vinifera reference genome.

## Practical Applications
This research contributes significantly to understanding the molecular basis of genotype/phenotype relationships in grapevine rootstocks, providing a platform for associating genes with phenotypes and exploiting natural genetic diversity to develop superior genotypes.
