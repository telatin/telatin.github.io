title: Bash training time
---

This February I'll deliver a second edition of the [Bash for Bioinformatics](https://seq.space/notes/doku.php?id=bash-beginners) training, at the Quadram 
Institute.

Some updates:

 - There is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash) with toy files
 - For the advanced users, a primer on [Bash Scripting](https://medium.com/ngs-sh)
