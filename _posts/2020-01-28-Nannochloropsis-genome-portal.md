title: Nannochloropsis genome portal (moved)
---

During my PhD (2012), I made the *Nannochloropsis gaditana* genome portal, and also
secured the *nannochloropsis.org* domain for it.

After 8 years, I realised that some resources where no longer being maintained
by the original department, and most of the features of the site were no longer
needed. 

Nevertheless, the content of the website is still available at a new address:
