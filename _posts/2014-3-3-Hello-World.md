This is only a test, trying this **vim** powered website that I can update from any shell basically. 
Nice to type like it's 1995, but times have changed and we are currently easily backed by a GitHub repository with some benefits like versioning.

I'm currently refreshing the contents in my website and this is a very low priority task, as usual, so...
