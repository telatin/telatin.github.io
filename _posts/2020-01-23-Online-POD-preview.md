title: Online POD preview

The [Plain Old Documentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlpod) is probably
only **old**, and no longer plain (who would say to _prefer_ POD to MarkDown, 
for example)?

But when POD is needed, there are two resources I love:

 * [Online Live POD Preview](http://podwebview.odyniec.net/#) - Choose your theme (MetaCPAN included) and draft your POD online
 * [MetaCPAN's renderer](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlpod) - Somehow official preview for MetaCPAN documentation
