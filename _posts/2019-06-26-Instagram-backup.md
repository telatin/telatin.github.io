In an early *throw back thursday* mode, I found a (relatively old) Instagram backup in my hard disk. 
What you get is a full collection of pictures and a JSON files with their captions, or at least this was what more than
one year ago Instagram gave you.

For fun I wrote a small script to make some HTML, and this is the beta result:

I requested an updated dump, and if the format is somehow similar to what I got in the past, I'll release the script
to make the gallery.
