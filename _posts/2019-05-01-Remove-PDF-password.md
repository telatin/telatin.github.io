title: Remove PDF password CLI
---

There are handy command line PDF manipulation tools, and while in the past I used several times `pdftk` (to cut and paste pages...), I noticed that its installation in *macOS* is not as easy as it is under Linux, so I gave a try to `qpdf`, that worked perfectly.

Just not to forget, the procedure is in the usual CLI notebook:
